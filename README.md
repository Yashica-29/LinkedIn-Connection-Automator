# LinkedIn-Connection-Automator

## Project Overview

The LinkedIn Automation Project is designed to automate the process of sending connection requests on LinkedIn. This project utilizes Selenium and the undetected-chromedriver library to handle the web interactions and manage LinkedIn's login process. The main goal is to streamline and simplify the process of expanding your LinkedIn network by automatically sending connection requests to potential contacts.

## Key Features

•	Automated Login: The project handles the login process to LinkedIn using pre-saved cookies, eliminating the need for manual login every time.

•	Cookie Management: Saves and loads LinkedIn session cookies to maintain login sessions.
